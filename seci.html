                    <h4> Summary </h4>
                    <p> This assignment covers the first topic in this course, whereas we were tasked to create a detailed solution for 6 topic-related questions. The questions cover the calculation of sets, proving sets using laws, applying the union principle, working with logical propositions, using truth tables to prove logically equivalent propositions, and the direct proofing method. To ensure that everyone fully understands the topic, we agreed on trying to solve all the questions by ourselves first before discussing it. During our discussion, we discussed our answer and come out with the most detailed and correct solution for each question. </p>
                    <h4> Reflection </h4>
                    <p> This assignment stregthen my overall understanding of the Set Theory & Logic topic especially during discussion with group members and consultation with the lecturer. I was able to ask questions, share my opinions, and help others understand the concepts. I also learned the importance of being careful and detailed especially when doing proving problems. Solving questions with long problem statement further enhanced my analytical skill and critical thinking when identifying the key elements and designing the solution of the problem. By the end of the assignment, I feel confident to answer more questions related to this topic especially as it was asked during the mid semester examination.</p>

                    <h4> Summary </h4>
                    <p> This second assignment covers the second topic of this course, and we were required to solve 7 topic-related questions. The questions were centered around the application of relational concept into determining a type of relation, working with function equation and determing its type, and building and tracing an algorithm for a relation. We uses the same approaches and discussed our answers after completing it. We were able to came out with the best solution after a thorough discussion by identifying any issues, refering to lecture's notes and combining our ideas. </p>
                    <h4> Reflection </h4>
                    <p> From this assignment, I received a better understanding on how to apply what I had learned during lectures into solving exam-like questions. Eventhough we had been introduced to this topic since high school, there are still a lot to learn in ensuring we fully understood and be able to solve the problems exactly like how the questions asked. The topic of recurrence & recursive relations might be the most trickiest subtopic, as the questions usually require the skill of critical thinking and problem-solving skill. However through discussion, we managed to help on each other's understanding and solve the problem correctly. </p>

        <p>
            This course has taught me the mathematical knowledge that is essential in the Computer Science field for solving problems and designing solutions. Not only that, this course has also enhanced my critical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills as I had to apply them when solving mathematical problems. I had also polished my soft skills by doing group assignments as we all work together to the success of our project. Overall, this course is essential and beneficial to us students especially Computer Science students as we all needs the mentioned skills to apply them when designing system, troubleshooting and leading a project.
