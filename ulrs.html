                    <h4> Summary </h4>
                    <p>
                        For our first assignment, we were tasked to propose an idea based on a chosen topic related to different forms of corruption occurring in our country. Our group selected the topic “Corruption in Sports” to provide better exposure and awareness to the public regarding this issue. The first step in designing the poster was to collect responses from students through an online survey created using Google Forms. The purpose of the survey was to assess students’ level of awareness regarding corruption in the sports industry, its effects, and the actions that should be taken to combat this issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our poster covers several subtopics, including the background of corruption in sports, case chronology, methodology, objectives, concepts of integrity and corruption, comparisons between local and global cases, research findings, conclusions, and suggestions to eradicate corruption in sports. The findings from the survey were also incorporated to support and enhance the content of the poster. After designing the poster, we presented our poster to the whole class to explain and help them understand the topic that we had highlighted in the poster.
                    </p>
                    <h4> Reflection </h4>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the assessment, I was able to gain a deeper understanding and acquire new knowledge about this relevant topic through the creative and engaging use of media, which made the content easier to read and comprehend. By sharing and presenting our poster to others, we believe that more people, including the public, will become aware of the different forms of corruption occurring in our country and understand the importance of taking action to prevent such issues from continuing to harm our nation. Additionally, reading the work of other groups provided me with valuable new insights. I believe this method of assessment is highly effective and should continue to be included as part of the course evaluation.

                    <h4> Summary </h4>
                    <p>
                        For our second assignment, we were tasked with creating a Public Service Announcement (PSA) video on our selected topic, “Corruption in Sports." Proper planning and management were crucial to completing this assignment successfully, so we held detailed discussions to develop the storyline, assign actor roles, and plan the shooting setup, including locations and timing. After the planning was finalized, we proceeded to write the script and dialogue for each character to complement the storyline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our storyline takes place during a marathon competition, where the main character’s coach asked her to take a “shortcut” with the help of a crew member who has already been bribed during the Marathon event, in order to secure her victory. The video highlights the importance of honesty and integrity and demonstrates the consequences of engaging in unethical behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shooting process went smoothly, and video editing was completed shortly afterward. Finally, we uploaded the video to YouTube to share it with others and raise awareness about corruption in sports.
                    </p>
                    <h4> Reflection </h4>
                    <p>
                        I had a lot of fun during the completion of this assignment as it involves many fun activities and elements, a different approach to learning about this course. For this assignment, I took the role of one of the Marathon crew member, took part on the shooting of the video and also the editing of the video. Me and my other groupmate, Nazirah collaborated together into finishing the editing of the video. I learned the skills of editing, collaborating as well as communication and teamworking skills with my other groupmates through the whole process of creating the video. Not only that, I also gained a lot of valuable information by watching other groups' videos which were very information and engaging. I believe this type of assignment is highly beneficial as it effectively raises awareness both among students and the public.

        <h2> Reflection </h2>
        <p>
            What this course taught me was the importance of integrity and ethics in shaping an individual’s identity. Having strong academic abilities and excellent soft skills does not define true success if one lacks moral values. Through this course, I also gained greater exposure to current issues and relationship challenges within today’s community that need to be addressed and prevented. In other words, I aspire to become someone who can guide and influence others to do the right things by serving and contributing to the community through leadership and spreading awareness using various platforms. These are the values and approaches emphasized throughout this course. By the end of the course, I gained a deeper understanding of why this subject is introduced to students, and I hope to apply what I have learned in my life to positively shape both the community and myself.
