                        This assignment required designing a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) calculator using flowcharts. The calculator estimates the energy expended at rest based on user inputs such as age, gender, weight, and height. The solution incorporates branching to select the correct BMR formula for males and females, loops to allow repeated calculations for multiple users, and a user-defined function to modularize the BMR computation. The flowchart clearly shows the input, processing, and output steps, making the process organized and easy to follow.

                    <p>
                        Completing this assignment gave me a deeper understanding of how to translate theoretical concepts into practical applications. I learned the importance of branching, which allows the program to make decisions based on user input, and loops, which improve efficiency by enabling repeated calculations without rewriting code. The use of user-defined functions demonstrated how modular design makes a solution more organized. In addition, this assignment helped me realize the value of planning before coding, as creating a detailed flowchart made the steps of the calculation clear and logical. I also developed better problem-solving and analytical skills, since I had to think carefully about the order of operations, handle different scenarios, and consider invalid inputs. Working on this flowchart also strengthened my attention to detail, especially when designing the logic for formulas, loops, and function calls. Overall, this exercise not only improved my understanding of algorithm design but also prepared me for future programming tasks, where clear logic, modular functions, and structured flow need to be applied.

                        This second assignment uses the same problem statement from before, but making it as a complete program instead. It requires the students to apply their technical programming skill to design the complete coding of the BMR calculator. Examples of input and output of the BMR calculator application was shown as a guide to develop the BMR calculator and students are expected to produce the same output as the example.

                        This assignment tested my understanding of the topics learned in class by requiring me to write a complete, functioning C++ program. Working in a pair was very meaningful, as it allowed me to discuss ideas, collaborate on coding, and divide tasks, which helped minimize errors and made the workload more manageable. Through this process, I also learned the importance of teamwork, communication, and reviewing each other’s work to ensure accuracy. Overall, this assignment strengthened my programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and confidence in applying theoretical concepts to practical coding tasks.

                        The last assignment requires students to write a complete C++ program that can assist a telematch committee to determine the winner for an event. A file with the scores of several individuals in a few different teams are given and students are required to use that file and information in their program. They also need to produce an output information as shown in the example and write it into an output file. This assignment tested the ability of students to apply the technique of using functions, file operations, arrays and output formatting in a program.

                        This assignment has challenged my understanding in applying a few topics that I have learned in class into one complete program. Eventhough those few topics were considered hard for me however by doing this assignment with the help and guidance from my partner has helped me to understanding those topics better. We worked together to make sure our program can run functionally and with a complete precision

        <h2> Reflection </h2>
        <p>
            Through this course, I have gained valuable coding skills that will play a major role in my academic journey as a Computer Science student. Starting from the introductory concepts and simple coding tasks and progressing to a more complex programs, I was fully engagged throughout the whole semester as it was a very interesting journey. I can now build my own project using the computing skills that I had learned and will no doubt be able design a bigger project as I advance further into the course. This course has also taught me a few essential skills such as analytical thinking, problem-solving, and logical reasoning. Not only that, It had also developed my ability to work better under pressure especially when I had to code under a short amount of time. Overall, it was a very exciting journey and I hope I can obtain more knowledges in the the future semesters through similar course.
