                    <h4> Summary </h4>
                    <p>
                        In this lab session, we were briefed about the safety and regulations before starting the lab session as this session requires the handling of electrical components which can be quite harmful if not handled using the correct technique. We were then given several ICs, namely a 7408 Quad 2-input (AND Gate), 7404 Hex Inverter (NOT Gate), 7400 Quad 2-input (NAND Gate), 7432 Quad 2-input (OR Gate), ETS-5000 Digital Training kit, breadboard and wires. Using all these materials, we have to design a complete functioning circuit that can read input(s) and produce output(s) based on it. After completing the circuit, the results are written in truth table form and derive a Boolean Expression based on it, while also asnwering a few other related questions. This session covers mostly about the fundamental concepts of combinational logic gates to strenghten the students' understanding on the basic parts before progressing to a more complex problems and topics.

                    <p>
                        This lab session was a greatly engaging and fun activity, as I was able to work with a real circuit after learning about it during lectures. Buidling the circuit has greatly enhanced my understanding on the topic of Logic Gates and at the end of the session I became more confident to try on solving future related-problems involving logic gates. Not only that, this session also polished my teamworking and analytical skill especially when building the circuit and encountering problems, which require us to work together and think logically on how to solve it. Overall, I hope more lab sessios can be conducted so that I can gain more benefical experiences like this.                    </p>

                    <h4> Summary </h4>
                    <p>
                        This lab introduces students to Deeds Simulator, a digital circuit simulator designed for learning purposes. In this session, we learned on how to design a digital logic circuits using Deeds Simulator, generate truth tables based on the outputs produced, and create timing diagrams. The lab covers the complete process of building and simulating combinational circuits, including gates, flip-flops, pre-defined circuits, and custom components such as finite state machines.                    </p>
                    <h4> Reflection </h4>
                    <p>
                        This lab helped me understand how digital circuits are designed and simulated in a practical environment. Using Deeds Simulator, I was able to connect theoretical concepts from lectures to creating a digital circuit from scratch. It also improved my problem-solving and attention-to-detail skills, especially when designing circuits and verifying their behavior. Overall, this experience strengthened both my understanding of digital logic and my confidence in applying it to practical tasks.                    </p>

                    <h5> Task: Build a Synchronous Counter Circuit using Deeds Simulator <h5>
                    <h5> Submission: 11 January 2026 <h5>
                    <h4> Summary </h4>
                    <p>
                        The third lab activity for this course expose the students to another hands-on experience, where they need to construct a synchronous counter circuit using elements such as Flip-Flop IC, Basic Gate IC, Breadboard and ETS-5000 Digital Kit. After constructing and running the circuit, students need to record their observation in figures such as state table and state diagram. Based on the observation, a few questions regarding the properties of the circuit can be answered such as the type of counter, indicator for counter and available states. Aside from the physical circuit construction, students may also construct the circuit virtually using the Deeds simulator application, either to validify the results or to get a clearer understanding on the lab activity.
                    </p>
                    <h4> Reflection </h4>
                    <p>
                        This practical application of building a circuit has helped me understand the topic of counter better. Connecting theoretical knowledge to hands-on activity allows me to view the concept in different ways, where I can polish my understanding on some concepts that may be confusing in slides but actually looks simpler in real life practice. From this activity, it is undeniable that learning indeed needs to matter beyond the classroom as well, since it covers a few concepts that in class learning may not be able to clearly deliver. For instance, I was at first confused on what the PRESET and CLEAR inputs actually function in the first place, however after doing the circuit I now understand what they actually do, which is to simply set or clear the input or output. Nonetheless, both in class and practical learning are essential and complements each other to help me strongly comprehend the knowledge and comprehension of the whole topic.

        <p>
            From this course, I had obtained valuable knowledges espacially on how to apply the digital logic concepts into solving theoretical and practical problems. I learned the concepts of numbering systems, Boolean algebra, logic circuits, and the components and features of logic gates used in computers. The lab sessions have further strenghten my understandings on these concepts, enhancing both the ability to work in group and hands-on skill. This course also developed my normative skill and critical thinking during solving logic problems and designing project. Overall, this course provided many crucial takeways that I'll be applying in my future studies.
