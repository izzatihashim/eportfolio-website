                        During the session, Tuan Alim highlighted how Project Management & System Development skill is needed for Data Engineers especially in building a structured data pipeline. He also emphasized on how this skill is crucial as building a project is not just about coding, but the entire process of defining, designing, testing, implementing and maintaining it.
                        He taught us on how to view this in several different ways, and one of them is by taking cooking Nasi Lemak as an example. You did not just put anything into it, you plan and coordinate what ingredients that you want to put to ensure that your cooking will turn into a Nasi Lemak. By using this example, he also taught us about the Waterfall and Agile methodology. Waterfall is a structured but inflexible method, whereas if in the first place I want to cook Nasi Lemak, then I need to go through the process of cooking it one by one without changing the menu. Meanwhile Agile method is an iterative and flexible method, where the outcome of a project will depends on the situation of it. Let's say in the process of cooking the Nasi Lemak, I suddenly wants to eat white rice but with Ayam Kuah Sambal, then I can easily adapt my plan and change my cooking process to focus on preparing the chicken dish.
                        Other than that, Tuan Alim also shared about the new era we are advancing into, that is the the Agentic Coding era. He highlighted how using AI is now valued in most company, as it can improve the whole productivity, reduce costs and assist in bulding complex designs. It is not about 100% asking the AI to do everything, but it's leaning towards using AI as an assistant that can do the small and syntax parts while you do the big and hard part such as the architecture and System Design.

                        Our group worked on the theme “Smart Campus Data Solution: Improving Student Experience through Data,” aiming to help students easily find suitable study spaces and improve campus study area utilization. We followed the five stages of the design thinking process. In the empathy stage, we conducted surveys and interviews to understand students’ experiences and challenges when finding study spaces. During define, we identified key problems, such as overcrowding and noisy environments. In ideate, we brainstormed a solution featuring a list of campus study spaces with occupancy levels, filters for preferences, and detailed seating information. For prototype, we created both low-fidelity sketches and a visual prototype in Canva to demonstrate the interface. Finally, in testing, students tried the prototype and provided feedback, which helped us refine the solution to better meet their needs.

                        This design thinking project has helped me gain a clearer understanding of how to successfully manage a project by using a real-world problem. Going through different phases allowed me to better understand the issue and design an effective solution. The project also strengthened my critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, which are essential for my future career. Overall, I wish to apply everything that I had learned while making this project into future projects and assignments that I will be doing.

                        This lab session gives students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in disassembling and assembling a PC. It started off with the briefing session by the staff on how to handle each components, starting from removing the wires, power supply, RAM, hard disk, and the cooling fan at last. The students were also divided into several small groups to ensure everyone will be able to experience it. After successfully disassembling it, we had to assemble it back component by component and step by step, and went through a testing session to check whether the components are assembled correctly and can resume its function. At the end of the session, a quiz was conducted with questions related to the session.

        <h2> Reflection </h2>
        <p>
            This course has taught me a lot about the fundamental knowledge in learning Computer Science. It is undeniably an essential course that needs to be introduced to all first-year students of Computer Science to help them strengthen their fundamental knowledge before diving deeper into the digital world. From this courses, I have learned about the emerging technologies in ICT, get to know the components in hardware and software, both in slides and also in real life during the PC Assemble Lab that allowed me to practice what I have learnt in class into practical activity. Other than that, I have also learnt more in depth about the Information Systems and Methodology, Databases and Data Analystics and also other course program's knowledge such as Networks and Communications, Privacy, Security, and Ethics in computing and last but not least about cloud computing that is also an emerging technology in today's world. What excite me most about this course is the way of teaching my lecturer possessed. Dr Aryati has a variety of fresh and engaging teaching styles to keep the students engrossed in her teaching. Not only that, she always make sure to engage her students in doing presentations, group discussion and also acting as a way of learning instead of just passively listening to her lectures. Overall, I picked up a lot of useful new knowledges from this course, it has enhanced my creativity, criticial thinking, polished my team-working skills and strengthen my overall soft skills that promotes my self and professional growth.
